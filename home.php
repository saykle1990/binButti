            <p>BBIH is a world-class holding company with operating companies spanning many of the sectors critical to
                the UAE's economic growth. We support the UAE's key industries through expert services, manpower and
                products designed to cultivate economic success.
            </p>

            <p>BBIH was founded by a well-established UAE national family in 2012 - a background which gives us
                intricate knowledge
                of local markets. Yet we recognise the importance of diversity and global talent, and have on-boarded
                teams from around the world to lead rapidly growing businesses that are contributing to regional
                prosperity.
            </p>

            <p>We use our world-class processes, resources and expertise to support our operating businesses in their
                market-beating growth. Our centralised support gives our operating companies a competitive edge when
                competing for market share.
            </p>

            <p>BBIH is committed to the UAE's future. We operate in sectors that support the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision
                2030's aims of building a diversified economy powering a global capital city. Our strategy is also
                aligned with the UAE Vision 2021.
            </p>

            <p>At BBIH, we believe that economic success, national prosperity and corporate social responsibility are
                entirely interlinked. We mandate adherence to best practices, ethical operations and employee welfare in
                all we do.

                    <p>Welcome to BBIH, a holding company and private equity investor
                        with global ambitions tied to local roots. Our aim is to cultivate
                        business success that supports the UAE's incredible progress and
                        dynamism. We follow the direction and example set by the UAE's leadership by adhering to a few
                        basic principles.
                    </p>

                    <p>We like bravery and entrepreneurial spirit -
                        and give our operating companies the talent, resources and autonomy to succeed.
                        We prefer working in transparent and ethical ways, because we believe that responsible
                        business practices are the only way to long-term success. We believe in going above and
                        beyond the norm to deliver excellent customer service in all we do, knowing that our market
                        reputation is an invaluable asset. We prioritise employee welfare, recognising that motivated
                        employees are our greatest assets.
                    </p>

                    <p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we are committed to the prosperity and
                        sustainable development of the UAE. We have made it our mission to align ourselves with
                        Abu Dhabi Vision 2030, and want to play a leading role in bolstering the UAE's role as the
                        epicentre of global trade, tourism, hospitality and innovation.
                    </p>

                    <p>BBIH';s operations are expanding rapidly, and earning market
                        leadership positions across strategic industry sectors across the region.
                        I welcome you on this journey, and extend my personal thanks to each and every team
                        member who makes our continued success possible.
